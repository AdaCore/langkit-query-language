# This test checks that aggregate project containing multiple aggregated
# projects are handled correctly:
#  1. Each aggregated project is analyzed independently.
#  2. External attributes clauses in the aggregate project are correctly taken
#     into account in aggregated projects.
# Hence we must detect two times the violation in src_2/test.ads.
