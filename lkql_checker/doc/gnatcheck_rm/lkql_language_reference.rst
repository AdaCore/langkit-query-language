The `libadalang API <https://docs.adacore.com/live/wave/libadalang/html/libadalang_ug/python_api_ref.html>`_
can be called from LKQL and is the basis for most of the GNATcheck rules.

In addition, LKQL comes with a built-in standard library described in :ref:`LKQL_std`, as well as
a LKQL stdlib module described in :ref:`LKQL_stdlib`.
